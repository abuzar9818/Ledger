# Ledger API

Ledger is a Node.js, Express, and MongoDB backend for banking-style account management, transfers, scheduled payments, audit logging, and admin approval workflows.

## Overview

The API supports three actor types:

- `USER` for normal customer flows
- `ADMIN` for review, control, and approval operations
- `SYSTEM` for internal automation such as scheduled transaction execution

The backend is structured for production-style workflows: authenticated access, role checks, rate limiting, audit trails, and approval-based account lifecycle changes.

## Key Features

- JWT-based authentication with bearer token and cookie support
- Role-based authorization with `USER`, `ADMIN`, and `SYSTEM`
- Account creation and balance tracking
- Manual transfers between accounts with ownership validation
- Scheduled recurring transfers with `DAILY`, `WEEKLY`, and `MONTHLY` recurrence
- Transaction status lookup and reversal support
- Daily transfer controls and idempotency support
- Account freeze and unfreeze controls for admins
- Account closure request workflow with admin approval or rejection
- Account reopen request workflow for closed accounts with admin-only approval
- Monthly summary reporting
- Audit logging for security-sensitive actions
- Token blacklisting on logout
- Rate limiting on auth and transaction-heavy routes
- Swagger documentation at `/api-docs`

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer
- MongoDB instance or Atlas connection

### Install Dependencies

```bash

```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://...
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=20
LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT=5
TRANSACTION_RATE_LIMIT=5

| PATCH | `/admin/reopen-request/:id/reject` | ADMIN | Reject a reopen request |

## Approval Workflows

### Close Account

1. User submits a closure request for one of their own accounts.
2. Admin reviews the request.
3. On approval, the account status changes to `CLOSED`.
4. On rejection, the request is marked as `rejected`.

### Reopen Account

1. User submits a reopen request for a closed account they own.
2. Admin reviews the request.
3. On approval, the account status changes to `ACTIVE`.
4. On rejection, the request is marked as `rejected`.

## Authentication Notes

- Requests can use either `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or the auth cookie.
- `SYSTEM` users are blocked from normal login flows.
- Admin-only routes are protected by the existing role middleware.

## Rate Limiting

- Auth routes use the configured login rate limit.
- Transaction and scheduled-transfer routes use the transaction rate limit.
- `SYSTEM` traffic is excluded from rate limiting.

## Notes for Development

- MongoDB must be available before starting the scheduler.
- Scheduled transfers run from the service layer, not through API routes.
- Audit logs are written for sensitive actions including transfer, freeze, unfreeze, reversal, and reopen approval.
